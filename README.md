# Overview
My entry point for web development. These are the projects I built when I started web development.

## Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. BOOTSTRAP
4. JAVASCRIPTS

## AIM

These Projects are aimed to sharpen my skills in web development. Every project here is built from scratch.

## OBJECTIVES
1. At the end of each project, I should be familiar with every keyword, element, tag etc used in the development process.
2. At the end of each project, I should have become a professional in building anything relevant to such or similar way to the projects and even think outside the box.
